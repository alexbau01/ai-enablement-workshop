# Simple Prompt:

## Prompt:

How many r's are in the word "strawberry"?

## Observation:

Most models will fail at this seemingly simple task. This is because the model has to understand the concept of a words and letters, and then count the number of times a specific letter appears in that word. This is a simple task for humans, but a difficult one for models, sice they think in tokens and not in words or characters. They can also not inherently count the number of times a specific token appears in a sequence.

# Prompt Engineering task:

Think of ways to make this task easier for the model. How can you instruct it in a way that it can understand and solve the task? Play around with different prompt ideas and test them against a model of your choice.
